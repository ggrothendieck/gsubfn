Title: Utilities for strings and function arguments.
Author: G. Grothendieck

Description: gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function
   or proto object rather than a replacement string.  Matches and 
   back references are input to the function and replaced by the 
   function output.  In the case of a proto object the object is
   used for sharing information from one match to the next.
   gsubfn can be used to split strings based on content rather than
   delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string interpolation. The 
   package also has facilities for translating formulas to functions 
   and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of functions.  
   This can reduce code size and improve clarity when using apply, 
   lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot and any other function that 
   expects another function as an input argument.  gsubfn also
   provides for quasi-perl string interpolation in arguments
   of any existing R function.
