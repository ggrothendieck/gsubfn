Description: gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function
   or certain other objects instead of the replacement string.
   Matches and back references are input to the replacement function and 
   replaced by the function output.   gsubfn can be used to split strings 
   based on content rather than delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string 
   interpolation. The package also has facilities for translating formulas 
   to functions and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of 
   functions.  This can be used with R functions such as apply, sapply,
   lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any other function that 
   expects another function as an input argument or functions like cat
   or sql calls that may involve strings where substitution is desirable.
