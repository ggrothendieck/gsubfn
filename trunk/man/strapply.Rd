\title{  
 Apply a function over a string or strings.
}
\description{
Similar to \code{"'gsubfn'"} except instead of performing substitutions
it returns the output of \code{"'FUN'"}.}
\usage{
strapply(X, pattern, FUN = function(x, ...) x, backref = NULL, ..., 
	empty = NULL,
	ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE, 
	engine = if (isTRUE(capabilities()[["tcltk"]])) "tcl" else "R", 
	simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE, combine = c)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{ list or (atomic) vector of character strings to be used. }
  \item{pattern}{ character string containing a regular expression (or
          character string for \code{"'fixed = TRUE')"} to be matched in the
          given character vector.}
  \item{FUN}{ a function, formula, character string, list or proto object 
          to be applied to each element of 
          \code{"'X'"}.  See discussion in \code{\link{gsubfn}}. }
  \item{backref}{See \code{\link{gsubfn}}.}
  \item{empty}{If there is no match to a string return this value.}
  \item{ignore.case}{If \code{TRUE} then case is ignored in the \code{pattern}
		argument.}
  \item{perl}{If \code{TRUE} then \code{engine="R"} is used with
		perl regular expressions.}
  \item{engine}{Specifies which engine to use.  If the R installation
   			has \code{tcltk} capability then the \code{tcl} engine is used
			unless \code{FUN} is a proto object in which case the
			\code{"R"} engine is used (regardless of the setting of this
			argument).}
  \item{\dots}{ optional arguments to \code{"'gsubfn'"}. }
  \item{simplify}{  logical or function.  If logical, should the result be 
          simplified to a vector or matrix, as in \code{"sapply"} if possible?
          If function, that function is applied to the result with each
          component of the result passed as a separate argument.  Typically
          if the form is used it will typically be specified as rbind.}
  \item{USE.NAMES}{ logical; if \code{"'TRUE'"} and if \code{"'X'"} is 
	character, use \code{"'X'"} as
          'names' for the result unless it had names already.}
  \item{combine}{combine is a function applied to the components of 
  	 the result of \code{FUN}.
     The default is \code{"c"}. \code{"list"}
     is another common choice.  The default may change to be \code{"list"}
     in the future.}
}
\details{
If \code{FUN} is a function then for
each character string in \code{"X"} the pattern is repeatedly
matched, 
each such match along with
back references, if any, are passed to 
the function \code{"FUN"} and the output of \code{FUN} is returned as a list.
If \code{FUN} is a formula or proto object then it is interpreted 
to the way discussed in \code{\link{gsubfn}}.

If \code{FUN} is a proto object or if \code{perl=TRUE} is specified
then \code{engine="R"} is used and the \code{engine} argument is ignored.

If \code{backref} is not specified and
\code{engine="R"} is specified or implied then a heuristic is 
used to calculate the number of backreferences.  The primary situation
that can fool it is if there are parentheses in the string that are
not back references. 
In those cases the user will have to specify backref.
If \code{engine="tcl"} then an exact algorithm is used and the problem
sentence never occurs.

\value{
A list of character strings.
