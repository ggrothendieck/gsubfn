Title: Miscellaneous utilities for strings and function arguments.
Author: G. Grothendieck

Description: gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function
   rather than a replacement string.  Matches and backreferences
   are input to the function and replaced by the function output.
   gsubfn can be used to split strings based on content rather than
   delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string interpolation. The 
   package also has facilities for translating formulas to functions 
   and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of functions.  
   This can reduce code size when using apply, lapply, optim, integrate, 
   xyplot and any other function that expects another function as input.
