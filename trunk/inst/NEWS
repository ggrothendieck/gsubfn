
Changes in 0.2-1 

	o added "note difference" example in strapply

	o letters, LETTERS and pi excluded from args so 
	  x ~ sin(x*pi/180) can be shortened to ~ sin(x*pi/180)
	  and 
 	  x ~ LETTERS[x] can be reduced to ~ LETTERS[x]
  	  (previously it would have added pi and LETTERS to arg
	  lists in these two examples)

	o improved as.function.formula.Rd

	o fixes to eliminate R CMD CHECK warnings under R 2.5.0
